# Test Strategy for Saucedemo Automation Project

## Introduction

This document outlines the testing strategy for automating tests on [https://www.saucedemo.com](https://www.saucedemo.com). The focus is on verifying core e-commerce functionality using automation to improve testing efficiency and coverage.

## Testing Scope

- Functional testing of user login, product browsing, cart management, and checkout  
- Positive and negative scenarios for critical workflows  
- Cross-browser testing (if applicable)  
- Regression testing for core features

## Test Types

- **Smoke Testing:** Basic sanity checks to confirm key features work  
- **Functional Testing:** Detailed verification of workflows and features  
- **Regression Testing:** Re-running existing tests after changes  
- **Negative Testing:** Validating system behavior with invalid inputs

## Test Approach

- Use PyTest and Selenium for browser automation  
- Modularize test scripts for reusability  
- Use data-driven testing where applicable  
- Generate detailed test reports

## Tools & Environment

- Python 3.x  
- PyTest framework  
- Selenium WebDriver  
- ChromeDriver (or other browser drivers)  
- GitHub for source control  
- Optional: CI/CD integration (e.g., GitHub Actions)

## Entry and Exit Criteria

- Entry: Automation framework setup completed, test cases identified  
- Exit: All critical test cases automated and passing, bug reports logged for failures

## Risks and Mitigation

- Website UI changes may break tests → maintainable locators and page objects  
- Test environment instability → use stable test data and isolated runs
